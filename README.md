Yelp Clone
==========
This week's project is an introduction to working with Rails. The aim is to recreate the core functionality of Yelp such that:
- users can log in and out of the service
- users can add, edit, and delete restaurants
- users can leave reviews for restaurants

Only logged-in users should be able to create restaurants and leave reviews, users should not be able to edit or delete restaurants they did not add, and users can only leave one review per restaurant.

Current stage of project: restaurants can be created, edited, deleted, and reviewed. The next steps are introducing form validations, user management, and eventually an improved UX.
